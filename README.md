# Tak Game — Browser Version

This project is a browser-based implementation of _Tak_, a strategic abstract board game inspired by Patrick Rothfuss’s _Kingkiller Chronicle_.

Built with React, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS, it features a responsive 5x5 game board with interactive cells and lays the groundwork for online multiplayer gameplay.
